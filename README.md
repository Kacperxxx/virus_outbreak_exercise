# virus_outbreak_exercise


Assume the following system of differential equations,
where S is the number of susceptible, I the number of
infected and R the number of recovered people in a
population suffering from a virus outbreak. N is the sum of
S, I and R. Plot the graphs for the variables S,I, and R
assuming beta = 0.5 and gamma = 0.1 using the Forward
Euler method to numerically solve the system of ODE for a
time period of 200 days. Assume that at the start of the
outbreak we have 1000 susceptible and 1 infected person.
At which day do we have the greatest number of infected?
